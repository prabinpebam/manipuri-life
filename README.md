# Manipuri Life

Documentation hub for a **historically-accurate life-simulation game** set in the Meitei kingdom of
Manipur — a *playable ethnography* in the spirit of *Stardew Valley*, where historical
accuracy is a design constraint rather than set dressing. The exact era is an open decision: we are
choosing between five fifty-year windows spanning **1700–1950** (see *Choosing the Era* in the docs).

The documentation is presented with **Slate**, a zero-build static docs viewer (the
`docs-presentation` skill), reproduced here unchanged.

```

The nine numbered folders are the **documentation domains**. Each has an overview (`README.html`) that
lists and tracks the detail documents still to be written — this is how we "slowly detail out every
aspect." Add new pages into the relevant folder and register them in `docs/docs-manifest.json`.

## Managing assets

Images, references, fonts, and audio follow a simple two-stage flow:

1. **`_intake/`** — a repo-root inbox. Drop anything here, any name, no rules. It's meant to be messy and
   temporary.
2. **`docs/assets/…`** — the organized library. Rename, web-optimize, and move files here, then reference
   them from docs pages with `<img>` (only ever point at the library, never at `_intake/`).

The full workflow, folder map, and naming convention live on the **Asset Management** page
(`docs/00-foundation/asset-management.html`). Heavy source files (PSD, RAW, uncompressed audio/video) are
git-ignored — commit a web-friendly export instead.

## Live site (GitHub Pages)

The site is published with GitHub Pages from the **`master`** branch at the **repository root**
(`Settings → Pages → Source: Deploy from a branch → master / root`). Root — not `/docs` — is required
because `docs/index.html` loads the viewer engine from `../docs-presentation-skill/`, a path that sits
*above* the `docs/` folder. A root `index.html` redirect and a `.nojekyll` marker make the site work from
the bare URL and serve as raw static files.

> **Live at:** https://prabinpebam.github.io/manipuri-life/ (redirects to `…/docs/`)

## Viewing the docs locally

The viewer loads content with `fetch()`, so it needs an HTTP server (it will not run from `file://`).

```powershell
# from the repository root
python -m http.server 8080
# then open http://localhost:8080/docs/
```

## Authoring new documentation

1. Read `docs-presentation-skill/SKILL.md` — it is the agent-facing guide.
2. Copy `docs-presentation-skill/templates/page.html`, fill the slots, and save it into the right
   domain folder.
3. Lead every page with a **TL;DR**, and **visualise any data** (charts, diagrams, inline SVG) before
   falling back to prose.
4. Add an entry to `docs/docs-manifest.json` (`path`, `title`, `order`, `group`).
5. Flip the item's status on its domain overview and on `backlog.html`.

## Provenance

The concept and methodology were developed in a planning conversation and distilled into the
nine-phase method documented under **How We Work**. No historical claim here is authoritative yet —
every "seed fact" must be promoted to a rated entry in the fact database (see *Historical Research*).
